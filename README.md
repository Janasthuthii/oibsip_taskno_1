# Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales Data

## Project Overview

This project involves performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help a retail business make informed decisions. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadtalib786/retail-sales-dataset).

## Analysis & Findings

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing data and removed duplicates to ensure data integrity.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- Calculated mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for key variables.
- Identified basic trends and distribution patterns in the sales data.

### 3. Time Series Analysis
- Analyzed monthly sales trends and identified seasonality in the data.
- Calculated and plotted moving averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations.

### 4. Customer and Product Analysis
- Examined customer purchasing behavior and spending patterns.
- Identified top-selling and low-performing products.

### 5. Visualization
- Created bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps to visually represent the findings.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment.

## Results & Recommendations

### Key Insights:
- **Top Products**: Product A, Product B, Product C were identified as top-selling items.
- **Low-Performing Products**: Product X, Product Y, Product Z had the lowest sales.
- **Customer Segments**: High-spending customers were identified, and targeted promotions were recommended.

### Recommendations:
1. Increase stock for top-selling products, especially during peak sales months.
2. Implement targeted promotions for high-spending customer segments.
3. Focus on regions or categories with lower sales for potential growth opportunities.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the retail sales data, enabling data-driven decision-making for inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer relationship management. Further analysis could involve predictive modeling to forecast future sales trends.
